# Pydantic Project

This is a simple Python project to understand how **Pydantic** works in data validation.

---

## 📘 What is Pydantic?

**Pydantic** is a Python library that helps us:
- Create data models easily using Python classes.
- Validate and clean user input automatically.
- Avoid manual checks for types (like int, str, etc.).

It is used a lot with **FastAPI** and modern Python apps.

**Key Features of Pydantic:**

Type-Safe Validation: Validates data against Python type hints (e.g., str, int, List[str]).
Automatic Conversion: Converts data to the correct type (e.g., string "123" to int 123).
Error Handling: Raises detailed validation errors for invalid data.
Nested Models: Supports complex, nested data structures.
Serialization: Converts models to JSON (or other formats) for API responses.
Default Values and Optional Fields: Simplifies schema definitions.
Custom Validators: Allows custom validation logic.
